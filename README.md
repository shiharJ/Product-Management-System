- For write automated-integrated-test we use java library call "Test Container"


### Internal communication among services - MicroService Part 2

When communicate between services, it can be done Synchronous or Asynchronous.
Here Synchronous is relying on response,

But when services in the cloud, It has dynamic IP addresses,

So we are creating a discovery server for assign IP address initially for service and stores all the information of the services and do the communication,

for discovery server we use netflix, eureka server as a dependancy

```xml

<dependencies>  
    <dependency>        
	    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>  
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server</artifactId>  
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
    
```
